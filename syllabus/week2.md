# Week 2
*May 8 & 10th, 2018*

## Continuing Tracks

This week we'll be continuing work on tracks from last week: 

- [Digital Literacy](https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/digital-literacy) (if not completed)
- [Learn HTML](https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/learn-html-2) 

## Git, GitHub and the Console 

On Tuesday (May 8th) we will pause wherever you are within the previous tracks so we can shift focus on a new track:

- [Learning Git & GitHub](https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/learning-git-github)

I want to make sure we start learning console foundations, git and GitHub together as a class, as a lot of questons can come up at this point. This might feel like an abrupt shift, but we'll be using git and GitHub a lot over the rest of the course. Getting familiar with these things early will help us down the road as we steer back into tracks more focused on HTML, CSS & JavaScript.


## GitHub Study Notes Project

Starting May 10th I would like everyone to start keeping a study notes repository. You can find more at **Class Projects > [GitHub Study Notes](/lessons/github-study-notes.html)**
