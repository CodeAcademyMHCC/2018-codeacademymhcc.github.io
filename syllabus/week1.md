# Week 1

*May 1-3, 2018*

## Treehouse Tracks

These are the first two Treehouse tracks we'll be focusing on:

- [Digital Literacy](https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/digital-literacy) — Aim to be done by Thursday, **May 3rd, 2018**
- [Learn HTML](https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/learn-html-2) — Aim to be done by Thursday, **May 10th, 2018**

Due dates are goals at this point, but not strict. Some of this will be dictated by how fast we're able to move as a class.
