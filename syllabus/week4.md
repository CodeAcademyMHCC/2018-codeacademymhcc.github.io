# Week 4
*May 22nd & 24th, 2018*


## Git/Console Track, Study Notes, GitHub Pages & HTML

This week we'll be:

- Wrapping the [Learning Git & GitHub](https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/learning-git-github) track. 
- Changing the workflow we use for our ongoing [GitHub Study Notes](https://codeacademymhcc.github.io/projects/github-study-notes.html) project
- Creating GitHub pages to publish our own websites (Tuesday)
- Jumping back into the [Learn HTML](https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/learn-html-2) track (Thursday)

This week we are going to leave the Learning Git & GitHub track even if you have not fully completed it. We will continue using git and GitHub as part of our workflow going forward, so there will be no shortage of opportunities to practice what is covered in that track.
