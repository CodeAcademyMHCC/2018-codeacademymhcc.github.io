## Treehouse Tracks

These are the first two Treehouse tracks we'll be focusing on:

- [Digital Literacy](https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/digital-literacy) — Aim to be done by Thursday, **May 3rd, 2018**
- [Learn HTML](https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/learn-html-2) — Aim to be done by Thursday, **May 10th, 2018**

Due dates are goals at this point, but not strict. Some of this will be dictated by how fast we're able to move as a class.


## Learning Git, GitHub and the Console 

Once every student is somewhere in the **Learn HTML** track I'm going to ask everyone to temporarily shift gears so we can focus on learning console foundations, git and GitHub as a class. This might feel like an abrupt shift, but we'll be using git and GitHub a lot over the rest of the course. Getting familiar with these things early will help us down the road.
